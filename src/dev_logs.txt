Day 1 -> 13 June 2024;
Finally started on the website. 
Desided on the tech stack, Bun, Elysia, Htmx
Wrote up a elysia.js server file for my website, took some time to learn how to auto-download my resume
only simple routing is required for this website, hence minmal issues when writing the server
started designing desktop site, learnt more about css, especiall about animations and how flex box works.
Was able to come up with the typing animation, with reference to another persons project for the blinking cursor animation

Day 2-> 14 June 2024;
    Goals:
        1. Complete Projects Showcase
            a. Write Server-side code to read the database of projects and just select the ones i want to display and send to the htmx frontend
            b. Write a update script for the database to run and collect my github repos and store it in the db.
                - Side note: Maybe have an auth login site where i can select which repos i want to show and see if i want to manually edit any of the repo data.
            c. write front-end css to make the showcase look nice and attractive.

completed writing server side logic for my selected projects display. Had some issues querying a db, found out i wasnt using the sqlite library built for Bun
Started writing html for the projects div. Quite a bit to learn, in-terms of styling
